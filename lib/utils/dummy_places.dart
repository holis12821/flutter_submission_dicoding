The Park Hyatt Tokyo, which occupies floors 39 to 52 of a Shinjuku skyscraper—continues to be a noticeable presence in the city well after Sophie Coppola’s 2003 film catapulted it to icon status. Its prime location (Shinjuku is like Tokyo’s Time Square) makes it an ideal spot for first-timers to the city. Their New York Bar delivers dramatic views of the urban sprawl alongside live jazz. Plus, their Japanese-American fusion menu is the perfect way to whet your appetite for the country’s culinary adventures. (Think waygu beef burgers and sea urchin toast.) Their rooms are pristine, and classic, although the mint-green carpeting keeps it from getting too boring. Their helpful staff will also make adjusting to the 12-hour time change that much easier.",
